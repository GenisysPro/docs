# Doxygen-generated Documentation for GenisysPro

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GenisysPro/docs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GenisysPro/docs)

## What's this?
This is the place for [GenisysPro](https://github.com/GenisysPro/GenisysPro) API documentation, which is automatically generated by [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).

## How does this work?
The documentation is built and updated once a week automatically by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/GenisysPro/docs).  
Travis CI builds the Doxygen documentation from the latest GenisysPro source code on GitHub, then deploys it onto the `gh-pages` branch of [the repository](https://github.com/GenisysPro/docs).
Because the `gh-pages` branch is for GitHub pages, this documentation is accessible from the web.
The `master` branch of the repository stores Travis CI configuration file, build script and other files necessary for a build.

## How can I access this documentation?
Click [here](https://genisyspro.github.io/docs/index.html) to access the documentation from your browser.
If you are interested in source code of this documentation, you can have a look at it in the `gh-pages` branch. However, it is hard to see all the files, as there are too many of them!
